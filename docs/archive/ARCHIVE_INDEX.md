# 📦 Archive Index - Historical Documentation

**Purpose:** This archive contains historical documentation from the project's modernization journey.

**Created:** October 2025  
**Total Documents:** 130+ files

---

## 📋 Why These Documents Were Archived

During the modernization effort, we created **161+ documentation files** to track progress, decisions, and implementations. While valuable at the time, this created:

❌ **Documentation sprawl** - Hard to find information  
❌ **Duplication** - Same information in multiple files  
❌ **Confusion** - Unclear what was current  
❌ **Maintenance burden** - Keeping everything updated  

**Solution:** Consolidated into 5 core documents that tell the complete story.
