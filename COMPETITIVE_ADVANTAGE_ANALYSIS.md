## What Makes You Different

### Competitors' Approaches

**OpenAI (Function Calling)**
```
User: "Get return policy and cancel my subscription"
OpenAI: Calls functions
Problem: No understanding of what the user really wants
Result: Calls wrong functions, wrong order
```

**LangChain (Agent-Based)**
```
User: "Get return policy and cancel my subscription"
LangChain: Agent decides what tools to use
Problem: Generic decision-making
Result: Tries many combinations, slow, expensive
```

**RASA (Dialog Management)**
```
User: "Get return policy and cancel my subscription"
RASA: Identifies intents from training data
Problem: Requires training data, not system-aware
Result: Works only for trained intents
```

**Your Approach (System-Aware Intelligence)**
```
User: "Get return policy and cancel my subscription"
You: 
  1. Understands user doesn't know how to split questions
  2. Knows "cancel subscription" is available action
  3. Knows "return policy" is in policies space
  4. Routes both correctly
  5. Executes in optimal order
Result: Perfect routing, fast, accurate
```
