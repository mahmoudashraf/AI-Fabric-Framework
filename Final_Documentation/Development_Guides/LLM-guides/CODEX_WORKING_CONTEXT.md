# Codex Working Context

Purpose: compact, append-only context for this repo so future Codex turns do not depend on long chat history.

Rules:
- Append only important decisions, current status, changed files, tests, and blockers.
- Keep each turn compact. Do not paste logs, diffs, or long explanations.
- Prefer exact file paths, run IDs, and command names when they matter.
- Ignore noisy/unrelated working tree files unless they block the task.

## Current Session Decisions

- User wants concise chat feedback because long chat text can make Codex sessions unloadable.
- Maintain this file after meaningful turns with compact decisions/status only.
- Created this file as the compact append-only context log for future Codex turns.
- User wants meaningful completed changes committed and pushed by default; stage only relevant files and avoid unrelated local artifacts.
- Shopify Companion builder roadmap is mostly complete as engineering build-out, but not product-launch complete.
- Active Shopify product roadmap should prioritize: live release gate, product truth/pricing alignment, App Store package, design partner beta, Free+Starter launch, gated Elite, then second product.
- Previous live verification was red: Qdrant temp cluster HTTP 429, Railway/API rate limiting HTTP 429/code 1015, Shopify product service 502, marketplace/canonical rollout blockers.
- Railway HTTP 429/code 1015 means rate limiting; pause/retry later and avoid repeated full-suite spam.
- Shopify admin UI refactor target: merchant-first workflows, with platform/operator diagnostics hidden in Advanced.
- Shopify admin UI changed in `product-services/shopify-bridge-service/ui/src/App.tsx`: added tabs Home/Setup/Insights/Billing/Support/Go live/Advanced, simplified merchant summary, moved raw bundles/dossiers/webhook/vectorization internals to Advanced, added Billing section.
- Verification for Shopify admin UI refactor: `npm --prefix product-services/shopify-bridge-service/ui run build` passed; targeted Shopify backend tests passed; `git diff --check` passed; live bridge shell smoke passed.
- Local Shopify admin UI dev server was started on `http://127.0.0.1:5175/`.
- Production Shopify bridge root served a bundle containing new `Loom Companion` admin UI strings after commit `277da57d`; merchant may need Shopify Admin/hard refresh to see it.
- Support tools tab should explain internal/support purpose and avoid rendering long generated packet text; full packets stay available through copy/download actions.

## Open Working Tree Notes

- `.DS_Store` is modified and `log.txt` is untracked; treat as user/local artifacts unless explicitly asked to clean them.
