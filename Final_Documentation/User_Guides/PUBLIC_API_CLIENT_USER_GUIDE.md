# Public API Client User Guide

Status: current branch guide (2026-03-29)

This guide is for the **Public API Client** user type.

A Public API Client is not a human user in the platform UI. It is a machine client such as:

- a future Shopify app backend
- a vertical onboarding service
- an internal backend that provisions deployments programmatically

This user type interacts with the platform through the **public provisioning API**.

Companion docs:

- `Final_Documentation/User_Guides/PLATFORM_USER_TYPES_GUIDE.md`
- `changes/Productization/PLATFORM_PUBLIC_PROVISIONING_API_CONTRACT.md`

## 1) What A Public API Client Does

Public API Client responsibilities:

- create deployments programmatically
- inspect deployment state
- request apply/re-apply
- fetch runtime and connector base URLs
- resolve a stable `consumerId` to the currently bound deployment integration contract

Public API Client should **not**:

- edit drafts directly
- mutate platform secrets
- call Railway directly for provisioning
- use internal operator endpoints

The platform is the provisioning boundary.

---

## 2) Authentication Model

The public provisioning API uses a machine-client API key model.

Default request headers:

- `X-PLATFORM-CLIENT-ID`
- `X-PLATFORM-PUBLIC-API-KEY`

These header names are configurable through:

- `PLATFORM_PUBLIC_API_CLIENT_ID_HEADER`
- `PLATFORM_PUBLIC_API_KEY_HEADER`

The API itself is enabled through:

- `PLATFORM_PUBLIC_API_ENABLED=true`

In the current branch, public clients are configured centrally by the platform operator/admin team.

---

## 3) Public API Endpoints

Supported routes:

- `POST /api/public/deployments`
- `GET /api/public/deployments/{deploymentId}`
- `GET /api/public/deployments/{deploymentId}/status`
- `POST /api/public/deployments/{deploymentId}/apply`
- `GET /api/public/deployments/{deploymentId}/credentials`
- `GET /api/public/consumers/{consumerId}`
- `GET /api/public/consumers/{consumerId}/status`
- `GET /api/public/consumers/{consumerId}/credentials`

These routes are intentionally narrower than the internal operator API.

Consumer routes are the preferred external discovery surface once a deployment has been assigned to a consumer by the customer admin team. They return the same integration contract shape as deployment-based status and credentials routes, but they let the platform swap the bound deployment without forcing the external client to change identifiers.

---

## 4) Standard Integration Sequence

### 4.1 Create Deployment

Call:

- `POST /api/public/deployments`

Recommended request fields:

- `externalDeploymentKey`
- `name`
- `environment`
- `templateId`
- `autoApply`
- `callbackMetadata`

Use `externalDeploymentKey` as your idempotency key per client.

### 4.2 Inspect Returned Deployment Id

Persist:

- your own `externalDeploymentKey`
- returned `deploymentId`
- latest published version if you care about rollout tracking

At this stage the deployment id is still the correct control-plane id for:

- apply requests
- rollout tracking
- provisioning reconciliation

It is not the preferred long-lived runtime discovery key for external traffic once the customer has created a consumer.

### 4.3 Apply

If `autoApply=false`, call:

- `POST /api/public/deployments/{deploymentId}/apply`

You may provide:

- `versionId`

If omitted, the platform uses the latest published version.

### 4.4 Poll Status

Call:

- `GET /api/public/deployments/{deploymentId}/status`

Use this to determine:

- deployment status
- health status
- latest release state
- latest verification summary
- the runtime-facing integration posture and connection points when available

### 4.5 Fetch Credentials / Base URLs

Call:

- `GET /api/public/deployments/{deploymentId}/credentials`

Use this when your integration needs to store or bind the deployment connection points.

Preferred interpretation:

- use `integration.preferredIntegrationMode` as the primary integration decision
- use `integration.preferredChatBaseUrl` as the chat/runtime entrypoint
- use `integration.preferredCrudBaseUrl` for supported runtime-backed operational reads
- use `integration.preferredAuthContextUrl` to smoke-test the effective runtime auth contract for the deployment
- use `integration.runtimeAuthMode`, `integration.hostBackedRuntimeRequired`, and `integration.guidance` to decide whether your backend must proxy traffic
- check `integration.verifiedAuthContextRequired` before assuming `/api/chat/me/*` requires verified caller identity
- if present, use `integration.publicRuntimeBootstrapUrl`, `integration.publicRuntimeAuthorizationHeader`, and `integration.publicRuntimeTokenScheme` for public-runtime token bootstrap flows
- if present, use `integration.publicRuntimeTokenIssuerHint` and `integration.publicRuntimeDefaultAudience` as the deployment-advertised public token hints

Do not treat `connectorBaseUrl` as a customer-facing entrypoint. The public API intentionally withholds the internal connector URL.

### 4.6 Prefer Consumer-Based Runtime Discovery

Once a customer admin creates a consumer and binds it to a deployment, external backend or frontend callers should switch to:

- `GET /api/public/consumers/{consumerId}/status`
- `GET /api/public/consumers/{consumerId}/credentials`

This is the preferred production pattern for stable integrations.

The platform resolves:

- `consumerId -> current bound deploymentId -> current access/integration contract`

That lets the customer admin rebind the consumer to a different deployment without changing the external caller’s lookup key.

Important boundaries:

- consumer routes are read/discovery routes only
- create/apply still use deployment-oriented public provisioning routes
- current runtime auth modes do not change
- `consumerId` is a stable lookup key, not a credential

---

## 5) Idempotency Rules

### 5.1 Create

If the same client reuses the same `externalDeploymentKey` with the same request shape:

- the platform returns the existing deployment
- HTTP status returns `200`

If the same client reuses the same `externalDeploymentKey` with different key request fields:

- the platform returns `409 Conflict`

### 5.2 Apply

If the same target version is already:

- queued
- provisioning
- verifying
- already applied

then replay returns the same release summary with:

- `idempotentReplay=true`

This is what makes retry-safe backend integration possible.

---

## 6) What Your Backend Should Store

At minimum, store:

- your own external customer/shop/account id
- `externalDeploymentKey`
- returned `deploymentId`
- `consumerId` once the customer admin has created and bound one
- last known `integration.preferredChatBaseUrl`
- last known `integration.preferredCrudBaseUrl`
- last known `integration.preferredAuthContextUrl`
- last known `integration.preferredIntegrationMode`

Preferred production lookup behavior:

- use `deploymentId` for provisioning and apply operations
- use `consumerId` for runtime discovery and refresh

Only store bootstrap/token transport details when your integration actually uses public-runtime mode:

- `integration.publicRuntimeBootstrapUrl`
- `integration.publicRuntimeAuthorizationHeader`
- `integration.publicRuntimeTokenScheme`
- `integration.publicRuntimeTokenIssuerHint`
- `integration.publicRuntimeDefaultAudience`
- `integration.runtimeAuthMode`
- `integration.hostBackedRuntimeRequired`

For richer automation, also store:

- latest release id
- latest published version id
- deployment health state

---

## 7) Recommended Retry Behavior

For create:

- retry safely using the same `externalDeploymentKey`

For apply:

- retry safely for the same `versionId`
- treat `200` replay as success, not failure

For status:

- poll until the deployment reaches the state your integration needs

For credentials:

- only persist connection points after apply/status indicates the deployment is ready

For consumer-bound integrations:

- refresh status and credentials through `consumerId`
- do not assume previously cached runtime URLs stay valid after customer-side rebinding

---

## 8) Error Handling

Common response codes:

- `401`
  - invalid or missing public API credentials
- `403`
  - authenticated but not permitted for that resource
- `404`
  - deployment/version not found for that client
- `404`
  - consumer not found or not currently bound
- `409`
  - external deployment key reused with a conflicting request
- `400`
  - malformed or invalid request

Do not treat all non-`201` responses as failures. For idempotent operations:

- `200` can be the correct success result

---

## 9) Best Practices For Vertical Consumers

Do:

- treat the platform as the only provisioning system
- keep your own stable `externalDeploymentKey`
- persist `deploymentId` after first create
- prefer `consumerId` over raw `deploymentId` for long-lived runtime discovery
- use status/credentials instead of guessing deployment readiness
- re-fetch consumer credentials after customer-side rebinding

Do not:

- provision Railway resources directly
- depend on internal platform UI or internal APIs
- bypass the platform and hardcode runtime environments manually

This is especially important for Shopify and future vertical wrappers.

---

## 10) Shopify Mapping

For a future Shopify backend, the mapping should look like:

- Shopify shop/install id -> `externalDeploymentKey`
- Shopify storefront/backend consumer -> `consumerId`
- Shopify backend -> public provisioning API
- platform -> creates deployment
- customer admin -> binds consumer to the chosen deployment
- Shopify backend -> polls status and stores deployment urls

Shopify should consume this API, not reimplement provisioning itself.
