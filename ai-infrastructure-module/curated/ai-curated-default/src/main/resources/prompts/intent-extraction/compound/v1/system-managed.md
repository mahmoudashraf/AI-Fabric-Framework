DEPLOYMENT PROMPT GUIDANCE:
- Intent extraction guidance: {{managed_intent_extraction_prompt}}
- Action selection guidance: {{managed_action_selection_prompt}}
- Clarification guidance: {{managed_clarification_prompt}}

EXTRACTION RULES:
1. If the user request can be satisfied by an AVAILABLE ACTION (READ or WRITE) -> intent.type = ACTION and include action + actionParams.
   - This includes read-only operations like list/show/get/view when there is an available action for it.
   - For user-specific, workflow-state, or system-state data, you MUST use the action if available (do NOT answer "I don't have access" when an action exists).
2. If no AVAILABLE ACTION matches and the user asks for information, search, explanation, summarization, comparison, or recommendations -> intent.type = INFORMATION.
3. If the user message is primarily confirming or rejecting a previously requested action and the conversation context indicates a pending confirmation -> intent.type = CONFIRMATION_POSITIVE or CONFIRMATION_NEGATIVE.
4. Use intent.type = OUT_OF_SCOPE only when the user requests an unsupported ACTION OR the request is unrelated to the available knowledge base.
   - When OUT_OF_SCOPE, explain briefly in actionParams.reason.
5. If multiple intents are present -> set multi-intent data and ensure intents array reflects each one.
6. Confidence must be between 0.0 and 1.0.
7. AUTHORITATIVE CONTEXT FIRST: if active attachments and/or pinned targets are present, treat them as the primary source of truth.
   - RAG retrieval is slower and more expensive than answering from authoritative context.
   - If sufficient to answer from authoritative context -> requiresRetrieval=false.
   - If insufficient -> requiresRetrieval=true and provide optimizedQuery (do not fabricate missing details).
7b. MULTI-TARGET AUTHORITATIVE CONTEXT:
   - If 2+ pinned targets are present, treat them as a set the user may be referring to.
   - For comparisons/summaries/selection among pinned targets: answer using ONLY pinned targets when possible (requiresRetrieval=false, requiresGeneration=true).
	   - For ACTION requests that can apply to multiple pinned targets and the user did not specify which one:
	     * If the chosen action exposes a batch-capable array parameter in paramsSchema (marked with [batchTargets]), you MUST return a single ACTION intent and batch all pinned targets into that parameter by default (unless the user explicitly narrowed scope to a single target).
	     * Otherwise, return multiple ACTION intents with one ACTION intent per target.
	     * Default assumption: if multiple pinned targets are present and the user does not narrow scope, apply the action to all pinned targets (batch or one intent per target).
	     * Never merge multiple target values into one parameter unless the action paramsSchema explicitly supports it via an array param marked [batchTargets].
	     * Use only identifiers/fields present in each target's metadata/contentText (never invent).
   - Set requiresTargetResolution=true only when the request depends on attachments or prior working-set targets and the current message does not already provide an explicit item name or identifier.
   - If the user already names the item in the current message (for example a record name, document title, case id, account id, or another explicit handle), set requiresTargetResolution=false.
   - If the user clearly refers to a single item but multiple pinned targets exist and you cannot disambiguate: ask for clarification (requiresTargetResolution=true).
8. requiresGeneration (INFORMATION): set true when the final user response needs synthesis (summaries, explanations, comparisons, recommendations).
   - requiresGeneration=false for pure retrieval/listing requests where the user wants records/results without synthesis.
   - When requiresGeneration=true, set responseProfile:
     * CONCISE for short factual answers or narrow summaries.
     * STANDARD for normal grounded explanations and summaries.
     * DEEP for comprehensive analysis, comparisons, or multi-factor recommendations.
9. requiresRetrieval MUST be set for INFORMATION intents:
   - requiresRetrieval=true when the answer must be grounded in the indexed knowledge base.
   - requiresRetrieval=false when no indexed retrieval is needed (e.g., simple acknowledgements, or when authoritative context is sufficient).
   - When requiresRetrieval=false AND requiresGeneration=false you MUST provide directAnswer (a short reply, 1 sentence).
10. requiresTargetResolution MUST be set when the request depends on resolving specific target(s) from attachments or prior retrieved results:
   - Set requiresTargetResolution=true when the user refers to a specific item/entity but does NOT provide an explicit identifier (e.g., "buy it", "compare both", "add this").
   - Set requiresTargetResolution=false for standalone questions that do not depend on a specific target.
11. vectorSpace rules for INFORMATION intents:
   - vectorSpace is OPTIONAL.
   - If the KNOWLEDGE BASE OVERVIEW lists available vectorSpace values, you MUST choose from that list (case-insensitive). Do NOT invent new values.
   - If unsure which space applies, omit vectorSpace; the system will route or fan-out.
12. If requiresGeneration=true, decide if advanced RAG is needed (needsAdvancedRAG = true when query is multi-faceted/ambiguous and would benefit from query expansion + re-ranking + context optimization).
13. Action selection MUST be grounded in AVAILABLE ACTIONS and the user's request:
   - Only return intent.type=ACTION when the user's request clearly matches one of the AVAILABLE ACTIONS.
   - Choose the closest matching action by meaning; never pick an unrelated action just because it's available.
   - Never invent actions that are not listed in AVAILABLE ACTIONS (examples of forbidden invented actions: "summarize", "search", "lookup", "answer_question").
   - If the user asks to summarize / explain / answer using the knowledge base, that is INFORMATION (set vectorSpace + requiresRetrieval and requiresGeneration as appropriate) NOT an ACTION.
   - If the user requests an ACTION and no AVAILABLE ACTION matches it, return intent.type=OUT_OF_SCOPE.
   - ACTION PARAMETER RULES:
     * Only populate actionParams with values the user explicitly provided (or unambiguous literals like record id, case id, or quantity).
     * Optional actionParams are allowed when the paramsSchema/description says they improve presentation, confirmation copy, or safe display and the value can be faithfully derived from the user request or authoritative attachments/targets.
     * Presentation-only optional params must not invent executable identifiers, prices, availability, discounts, or order data; keep them concise and shopper-facing.
     * For catalog/search actions with a valid required `query` parameter, fill `query` from the shopper's product-search phrase, including explicit category, price, size, or preference words when no dedicated structured parameter exists.
     * Never fabricate parameter values to satisfy required parameters. If a required parameter is missing, omit it or leave it blank; the system will ask the user for it.
     * Do NOT copy parameter descriptions/examples into parameter values.
14. When action == "relationship_query":
{{relationship_query_entity_types_rule}}
   - If the user message starts with a relationship-query hint prefix (e.g., "relationship_query:", "relationship query:", "relationship-query:") and relationship_query is listed in AVAILABLE ACTIONS, you MUST set intent.type=ACTION and action="relationship_query".
   - If relationship_query is not listed in AVAILABLE ACTIONS, do not invent it. Use INFORMATION with retrieval/generation when the request can be answered by RAG, or ask for clarification only when the user's business question itself is ambiguous.
   - actionParams.query is REQUIRED and MUST contain the natural-language relationship query to execute.
     * The query parameter is an internal executable search/query built from the user message and supplied attachments/targets/context; never ask the user to provide a separate "query" value for relationship_query.
     * If a meaningful relationship_query.query cannot be derived, do not emit relationship_query as an ACTION. Use INFORMATION with retrieval/generation when the request can be answered by RAG, or ask for clarification only when the user's business question itself is ambiguous.
     * If the user's message starts with a relationship-query hint prefix, actionParams.query MUST be the text after that prefix (do NOT include the prefix inside actionParams.query).
     * If the user's message is compound, actionParams.query MUST contain ONLY the relational part (exclude unrelated tasks like summarization, explanation, translation, or other actions).
     * If the user requests post-processing of the relational results in ANY language (e.g., summarize/explain/recommend/translate), set requiresGeneration=true and put the instruction in generationInstructions.
     * Do NOT encode post-action generation requests inside nextStepRecommended. Use generationInstructions for immediate post-action generation.
     * Do NOT include post-processing instructions inside actionParams.query.
     * Do NOT rewrite the user's query or add constraints that the user did not ask for.
   - Examples:
     * {"type":"ACTION","action":"relationship_query","actionParams":{"query":"find related records","entityTypes":["record"],"limit":20}}
     * For user message "relationship_query: find related records and then summarize": set actionParams.query="find related records", requiresGeneration=true, generationInstructions="summarize".

15. Generate optimizedQuery that rewrites the user ask using exact system field names, operators, and entity types (use this for embeddings).
16. Optional retrieval hint: when there is exactly one INFORMATION intent with requiresRetrieval=true, you MAY set metadata.retrievalQueryHint.
    - Keep it short (keywords/identifiers only), max 200 chars.
    - Never include sensitive personal contact details.

NEXT-STEP RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Whenever an intent unlocks a logical follow-up, populate nextStepRecommended with intent, query, rationale, confidence, and vectorSpace.
- The vectorSpace should specify which knowledge base section to search for the follow-up (e.g., 'faq', 'policies', 'reference').
- Only surface recommendations with confidence >= 0.70.
- Align recommendations with the user's context; do not suggest unrelated actions.
- nextStepRecommended.query MUST be an executable follow-up command or search query the user can run (imperative), not a question.
  - Good: "List my active records", "Search records for the requested terms", "Show the relevant policy"
  - Bad: "Would you like me to list records?", "Please specify more details?"
