## 🎯 What to Expect

After uploading the prompt + files, the AI will:

1. **Review** the extraction script for safety
2. **Verify** all necessary files and dependencies exist
3. **Execute** the automated extraction:
   ```bash
   cd /workspace/ai-infrastructure-module
   ./docs/ARCH_REFACTORING/WEB_EXTRACTION/extract_web_module.sh
   ```
4. **Report** results:
   - New module created: `ai-infrastructure-web/`
   - Controllers moved: 6 files
   - Build status: SUCCESS/FAILURE
   - Next steps

## 📝 Alternative Prompts

### **For Manual Implementation**:
```
I need to extract REST controllers from ai-infrastructure-core 
to a new ai-infrastructure-web module using manual steps.

Files attached:
- WEB_MODULE_EXTRACTION_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md (40 pages, 7 phases)
- WEB_MODULE_EXTRACTION_QUICK_START.md (fast track)

Please guide me through the 7-phase implementation:
1. Setup
2. Move Controllers
3. Configuration
4. Testing
5. Documentation
6. Cleanup
7. Integration Verification

Working directory: /workspace/ai-infrastructure-module/
```

### **For Quick Understanding**:
```
I need to understand the web module extraction plan for 
ai-infrastructure-core refactoring.

Files attached:
- WEB_EXTRACTION_COMPLETE_PACKAGE.md (overview)
- README.md (from ARCH_REFACTORING/)

Please:
1. Explain what needs to be extracted and why
2. Summarize the approach (automated vs manual)
3. Estimate effort and risks
4. Recommend best option

Context: This is part of a larger core module refactoring initiative.
```

### **For Full Context Review**:
```
I need to review the complete analysis and extraction plan for 
refactoring ai-infrastructure-core.

Directory attached: docs/ARCH_REFACTORING/ (entire directory)

Please:
1. Review ALL_ANALYSIS_DOCUMENTS_INDEX.md for overview
2. Explain key findings from core analysis
3. Review decisions in CHANGE_REQUESTS_LOG.md
4. Confirm web extraction readiness
5. Recommend immediate next steps

This is a comprehensive refactoring of an over-bloated core module.
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Prompts

### **If Script Fails**:
```
The web extraction script failed with the following error:

[paste error here]

Files attached:
- extract_web_module.sh (the script that failed)
- WEB_MODULE_EXTRACTION_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md (manual backup)

Please:
1. Analyze the error
2. Suggest a fix for the script
3. Or guide me through manual implementation as fallback

Working directory: /workspace/ai-infrastructure-module/
```

### **If Build Fails After Extraction**:
```
Web module extraction completed but build is failing:

[paste build error here]

Files attached:
- WEB_MODULE_EXTRACTION_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md
- WEB_EXTRACTION_COMPLETE_PACKAGE.md

Please:
1. Diagnose the build error
2. Check Phase 3 (Configuration) was completed correctly
3. Verify parent POM includes new module
4. Fix the build issue

New module location: ai-infrastructure-module/ai-infrastructure-web/
```

## 💡 Tips for Success

### ✅ **Do This**:
- Copy the **entire WEB_EXTRACTION/ directory** for best results
- Include the **working directory** in your prompt
- Mention the **script location** explicitly
- Ask AI to **verify** before executing

### ❌ **Avoid This**:
- Don't copy just the prompt without files
- Don't skip mentioning the working directory
- Don't forget to specify script is executable (`chmod +x`)
- Don't upload files without context
