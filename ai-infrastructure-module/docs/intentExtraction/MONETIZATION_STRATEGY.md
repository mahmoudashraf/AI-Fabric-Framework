## 🎯 TIER 1: Open Source Core (Free)

### Why Open Source First?

```
Benefits:
├─ ✅ Community validation
├─ ✅ GitHub stars → credibility
├─ ✅ Issue feedback → product improvement
├─ ✅ OSS community pulls → organic growth
├─ ✅ Trust building → easier to sell pro tier
├─ ✅ Organic adoption → faster growth
└─ ✅ Reference implementations → case studies

Timeline:
├─ Month 1: Release on GitHub
├─ Month 2-3: Build community
├─ Month 3-4: Launch Pro tier
└─ Month 5+: Grow enterprise deals
```

### License Strategy

```java
// LICENSE.md

MIT License (RECOMMENDED for your case)
├─ Pros:
│  ├─ Most permissive (companies love it)
│  ├─ Easy for enterprises to adopt
│  ├─ Compatible with most projects
│  └─ Simple to understand
│
├─ Cons:
│  ├─ Anyone can commercialize (risk)
│  └─ Easy copying (but hard for core IP)
│
├─ Why good for you:
│  ├─ Attracts Spring developers
│  ├─ Enterprises don't resist MIT
│  ├─ Large community adoption
│  └─ You protect via commercial license

Alternative: Dual License
├─ Core: MIT (Free for community)
├─ Pro: Commercial license (for companies)
└─ Result: AGPL alternative without the friction
```

### Revenue from Tier 1

```
Direct Revenue: $0

Indirect Revenue:
├─ Brand building (priceless)
├─ Community adoption → larger Pro tier market
├─ GitHub stars → credibility
├─ Case studies → enterprise sales fuel
├─ Content marketing fuel
└─ Hiring material (developers know your lib)
```

---

## 💳 TIER 2: Professional Tier (Freemium Model)

### Pricing Structure

```
PROFESSIONAL TIER: $49/month per application
├─ Based on: Per-application (not per-seat)
├─ Applies to: Production deployments
├─ Not charged: Dev/test environments
└─ Typical: $49-500/month depending on app scale
```

### How to Implement Tier Locking

```java
// In your library code

@Component
public class FeatureGate {
    
    @Autowired
    private LicenseService licenseService;
    
    public void requireProfessional(String feature) {
        License license = licenseService.getCurrentLicense();
        
        if (license.getTier() == LicenseTier.FREE) {
            throw new FeatureNotAvailableException(
                "System-aware extraction requires Professional tier. " +
                "Upgrade at: ai-infrastructure.com/upgrade"
            );
        }
    }
    
    public void requireEnterprise(String feature) {
        License license = licenseService.getCurrentLicense();
        
        if (license.getTier() != LicenseTier.ENTERPRISE) {
            throw new FeatureNotAvailableException(
                "Dedicated support requires Enterprise tier."
            );
        }
    }
}

// Usage in IntentQueryExtractor
@Service
public class IntentQueryExtractor {
    
    @Autowired
    private FeatureGate featureGate;
    
    public MultiIntentResponse extractWithSystemContext(String query) {
        // Advanced feature - requires professional
        featureGate.requireProfessional("system-aware-extraction");
        
        // Implementation...
    }
}
```

### Pricing Psychology

```
Why $49/month?
├─ Low barrier to entry (convert 20-30% of users)
├─ Perceived as "professional" tier (not cheap)
├─ For companies: trivial cost (~$600/year)
├─ For individuals: reasonable for business use
├─ Comparable to: Vercel ($20), GitHub Pro ($4), etc.

Upgrade incentive:
├─ Free tier is VERY limited (only core features)
├─ Most serious users need Professional features
├─ System-awareness makes $49 obvious choice
└─ Expected conversion: 15-30% of free users
```

### Revenue Projection: Professional Tier

```
Scenario: After 6 months
├─ Total library downloads: 50,000+
├─ Production deployments: 5,000 apps
├─ Professional tier adoption: 20% (1,000 apps)
├─ Revenue: 1,000 × $49/month = $49,000/month
├─ Annual: ~$600K from Professional tier alone
└─ Trend: Growing 10-20% monthly

Scale after 12 months:
├─ Total deployments: 50,000 apps
├─ Professional: 30% (15,000 apps)
├─ Revenue: 15,000 × $49/month = $735,000/month
├─ Annual: ~$9M from Professional tier
└─ This alone is a 7-figure business
```

## 🔐 License Key Implementation

### How to Verify Licenses

```java
@Component
public class LicenseService {
    
    private static final String LICENSE_ENDPOINT = "https://license.ai-infrastructure.com";
    
    public License validateLicense(String licenseKey) {
        // Call license server
        String response = http.get(LICENSE_ENDPOINT + "/validate", 
            Map.of("key", licenseKey));
        
        License license = parseResponse(response);
        
        // Cache for 24 hours (offline-capable)
        cache.put(licenseKey, license, Duration.ofHours(24));
        
        return license;
    }
    
    public LicenseTier getTier() {
        // Returns: FREE, PROFESSIONAL, ENTERPRISE
        License license = validateLicense(getEnvironmentKey());
        return license.getTier();
    }
}

// In application.yml
ai:
  license-key: ${AI_LICENSE_KEY}  # Env var
  offline-mode: true               # Works offline with cache
```

### License Verification Strategy

```
Goal: Prevent license sharing while being user-friendly

Approach:
├─ Validate once per 24 hours
├─ Cache result locally (offline support)
├─ Include unique machine ID
├─ Allow 3 different deployments per license
├─ No hard blocking (just logging + warnings)
├─ Clear error messages with upgrade link
└─ Support: Free tier never expires

This allows:
✅ Self-hosted enterprise deployments
✅ Dev/Test/Prod environments
✅ Server redundancy
✅ Blue-green deployments
✅ But prevents: Mass sharing of key
```
